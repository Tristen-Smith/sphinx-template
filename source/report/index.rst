Why is React the best right now?
--------------------------------
    Before React became such a big thing, there was a completely different approach
to web development. All you did was make static html pages and render them with
PHP. This way was used for a very long time before javascript libraries exploded
with popularity. Then React was introduced and paved the way for developers to
create dynamic applications very fast. At first it was mainly used to render views
on different applications. What essentially changed the game was that react
allowed reusable components that didn't depend on each other. Essentially, what
made react so good compared to the previous way was the speed and efficiency.
This means that when it comes to things like bugs or certain aspects of your
application breaking, it is controlled within an area. Since components are
independent of each other, one breaking doesn't mean everything goes down. With
all this information about react when it first came out, how is it still better
than competitors now? Firstly, a big part of choosing a framework is the
complexity of it. No one wants to use a framework that is difficult to learn and
implement to an application. React is a very simple and easy to learn framework
that makes using it for advanced or beginners very simple. Another huge reason
why React is still top of its games is all about how reusable it is. React, as
mentioned earlier, is made up of components. These are things like buttons, menus
, checkboxes, and so on. Why React is so good is because you can reuse all these
different components which simply means less redundant code. Finally, there is a
large collection of developer tools that exists out there. Its easy to think of
this like a shortcut in a giant maze. It is amazing to have pre build and ready
to use components of all different kinds. This simply makes writing you application
so much faster since you are not starting from scratch.
